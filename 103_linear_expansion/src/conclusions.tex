\section{Conclusions}

Based on the conducted measurements and data analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All three tested metals exhibit an almost linear relationship between length change and temperature within the examined range.
    \item Brass shows the highest linear expansion, followed by copper, and steel has the lowest.
    \item The determined coefficients $\alpha$ are consistent with typical literature values for these materials.
    \item The linear expansion coefficient allows predicting the rod's length change as a function of temperature, which is important for designing metal structures exposed to temperature fluctuations.
    \item The linear fitting method is appropriate within the range of small temperature changes, where the linear approximation of thermal expansion holds.
\end{itemize}
