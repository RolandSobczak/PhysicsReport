\section{Experimental Procedure}

During the experiment, the lengths of rods made from three different metals were measured:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Copper
    \item Brass
    \item Steel
\end{enumerate}

The procedure was as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, the initial absolute length of each rod was measured. The measuring device had an accuracy of 0.05 mm. The initial temperature was 24.2°C.
    \item Next, the temperature was increased in steps of 5°C and the change in length relative to the initial length was measured. Measurements were done with an accuracy of 0.01 mm.
    \item For simplification, measurements were performed at slightly different temperatures for each rod. The exact temperature for each measurement is reported in the results. The thermometer had an accuracy of 0.1°C.
\end{enumerate}
