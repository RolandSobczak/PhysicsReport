\subsection*{Determined Coefficients}

The coefficients $a$ and the linear expansion coefficient $\alpha$ were calculated using a linear fit of the measured length change $\Delta L$ as a function of temperature $T$ for each metal:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta L = a \, T + b
\end{equation}

Here, $a$ [mm/째C] is the slope of the fitted line, and $b$ is the intercept. The linear expansion coefficient $\alpha$ [1/째C] was then calculated by dividing the slope $a$ by the initial rod length $L_0$:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{a}{L_0}
\end{equation}

Metal & $a$ [mm/째C] & $\alpha$ [1/째C] \\

Copper & 0.013813 & $1.791 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \\
Brass  & 0.014608 & $1.894 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \\
Steel  & 0.009425 & $1.219 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \\
